## Questions

### 1. Elon Musk's Neuralink and Wider Adoption of BCIs
- **Question**:Many people, including myself, associate Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) with Elon Musk's Neuralink. While Neuralink claims its primary objective is to enable quadriplegics to control computers, I can't help but wonder if this statement is made mainly for government approval or public acceptance. Musk has frequently expressed concerns about AI being a potential threat to humanity. He also points out that the limited nature of human interaction with computers could be mitigated by BCIs. Given this, do you think BCIs will become mainstream as soon as human trials are approved?

### 2. Impact on BCI Drone Racing
- **Question**: How do you see the future of BCI-enabled drone racing evolving, especially considering invasive technologies like Neuralink,whereas your lab focuses on non-invasive BCI methods??

---

### 3. Invasive vs Non-Invasive BCI
- **Question**: Could you share your perspective and action plans concerning developments in invasive vs. non-invasive BCI technology?

---

### 4. BCI-Controlled Drone Swarms and AI
- **Question**: I'm particularly interested in the possibility of BCI-controlled drone swarms. How do you see generative AI contributing to this area?

---

### 5. Research Focus
- **Question**: Why is there such a focus on EEG and drones in your BCI research? Are there other methodologies or applications your lab is exploring?

---

### 6. Lab's Mission and Vision
- **Question**: Could you please elaborate on the lab's current mission and vision? Are they open to new possibilities or currently undergoing any pivots?

---

### 7. Inclusivity in BCI Activities
- **Question**: I have seen you mention that one of the  goal of using BCI is to include people with disabilities, such as those in wheelchairs, in various activities. However, I've noticed a lack of representation of such individuals in BCI racing videos. Could you shed some light on this?

---

### 8. Mindfulness and BCI
- **Question**: Does mindfulness or meditation practice enhance one's ability to control drones via BCI? If so, can you quantify its impact?

---

### 9. Daily Activities in the Lab
- **Question**: I'd be interested to know more about the typical daily activities in your lab. What are your current research priorities?

---

### 10. Hybrid Control Schemes for Drones
- **Question**:why do we have to rely controlling drone only with BCI interface, rather control with hands and use BCI for extra function? May be pitch/roll using BCI and other controls using RC controller? Was it tried , if yes what is the result?
